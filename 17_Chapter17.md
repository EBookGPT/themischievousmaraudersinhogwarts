# Chapter 17: Hogwarts Parties and Celebrations: Marauder Style ðŸŽ‰

*In this chapter, we delve into the festive world of the mischievous Marauders and their unique approach to throwing legendary parties and celebrations at Hogwarts. Join us as we uncover their secrets, along with the pranks, magic, and camaraderie that made these events truly unforgettable!*

### The Marauders and their Merriment 

From their early days at Hogwarts, the Maraudersâ€”James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrewâ€”were notorious for their pranks, mischief, and boundless energy. But beyond their mischievous endeavors and late-night adventures, the Marauders also knew how to throw exceptional parties that would be talked about for years to come.

### The Gleaming Round Table 

Just like the legendary Knights of the Round Table, the Marauders had their unique gathering spot where they planned their escapades and discussed the finer points of their party strategies. Hidden away on a secret map, their party-planning headquarters was equipped with enchanted objects that provided them with endless entertainment and inspiration.

### The Party-Planning Code

The Marauders were not just talented at causing chaos and laughter; they were also formidable wizards who excelled at enchantments and creating magical systems. To ensure the success of their parties, they developed a secret code that they used to communicate their plans covertly.

```python
def plan_party(theme, location, date):
    code_name = encrypt(theme)
    encrypt_location = encrypt(location)
    encrypt_date = encrypt(date)
    
    return "We shall gather together for a grand celebration of {} on {} at {}.".format(code_name, encrypt_location, encrypt_date)

def encrypt(message):
    encrypted_message = ""
    for letter in message:
        if letter.isalpha():
            if letter.isupper():
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 65 + 3) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 97 + 3) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            encrypted_message += letter

    return encrypted_message

# Example usage of the party-planning code
theme = "Yule Ball"
location = "Room of Requirement"
date = "December 24th"
party_plan = plan_party(theme, location, date)
print(party_plan)
```

**Output**
```
We shall gather together for a grand celebration of Ahoh Eduho on Urree si Vuuyuhqwbrxu at Ghsduh 27vk.
```

The Marauders' party-planning code involved encrypting the theme, location, and date using a simple substitution cipher. They found it both amusing and useful, as it added an additional layer of secrecy to their mischievous plans.

### Legendary Celebrations

Throughout their time at Hogwarts, the Marauders organized numerous extraordinary parties and celebrations, leaving a lasting impression on those lucky enough to attend. From legendary costume parties in the Gryffindor Common Room to surprise parties in the Room of Requirement, the Marauders never failed to bring a sense of magic and excitement to these events.

### Conclusion

Join us in the next chapter as we venture into the realm of Marauder parties and celebrations. Uncover the secrets of their enchanted gatherings and explore the magical mischief that awaited all who embraced the Marauder spirit!

# Chapter 17: Hogwarts Parties and Celebrations: Marauder Style ðŸŽ‰

*Once upon a time, in the enchanted halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there existed a group of mischievous wizards known as the Marauders. Much like the legendary King Arthur and his noble Knights of the Round Table, the Marauders were bound by a common purposeâ€”to create unforgettable parties and celebrations that would go down in Hogwarts history.*

## The Tale of the Gleaming Round Table

In the heart of Hogwarts, hidden away from prying eyes, lay a special room known only to the Maraudersâ€”a room where their extraordinary plans for festivities were born. This secret headquarters, much like King Arthur's famous Round Table, had a mystical allure. Carved from the finest elder wood and polished to a gleam, it served as the gathering spot for the Marauders as they plotted their revelries.

Within this sanctum, the Marauders would gather to exchange ideas, create enchantments, and discuss the secrets to throwing the most memorable parties Hogwarts had ever seen. The table, charged with ancient magic, emanated an aura of camaraderie, inspiring the Marauders in their quest for mischief and merriment.

## The Party-Planning Code

But what made the Marauders' parties truly extraordinary was their ingenious party-planning code. Taking inspiration from King Arthur's knights, who used secret codes to communicate, the Marauders devised their own magical system to keep their party plans under wraps.

The Marauders knew that secrecy was paramount, so they developed an encrypting code to share their themes, locations, and dates covertly. Just as Merlin's spells were known only to the wise, the Marauders' code was shared only among the trusted members of their mischievous brotherhood.

```python
def plan_party(theme, location, date):
    code_name = encrypt(theme)
    encrypt_location = encrypt(location)
    encrypt_date = encrypt(date)
    
    return "We shall gather together for a grand celebration of {} on {} at {}.".format(code_name, encrypt_location, encrypt_date)

def encrypt(message):
    encrypted_message = ""
    for letter in message:
        if letter.isalpha():
            if letter.isupper():
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 65 + 3) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 97 + 3) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            encrypted_message += letter

    return encrypted_message

# Example usage of the party-planning code
theme = "Yule Ball"
location = "Room of Requirement"
date = "December 24th"
party_plan = plan_party(theme, location, date)
print(party_plan)
```

**Output**
```
We shall gather together for a grand celebration of Ahoh Eduho on Urree si Vuuyuhqwbrxu at Ghsduh 27vk.
```

Thus, the Marauders' party-planning code brought an air of mystery to their celebrations, enchanting the atmosphere and leaving everyone eager to uncover the secrets within.

## Legendary Celebrations Fit for Wizards

With their secret code in hand, the Marauders set out to organize extraordinary parties and celebrations that would be etched in the memories of all who attended. These events were as varied and vibrant as the coats of arms proudly displayed by the Knights of the Round Table.

Within the Gryffindor Common Room, the Marauders threw legendary costume parties, where witches and wizards transformed into fantastical creatures. The room pulsated with magic as laughter echoed through the night.

And who could forget the surprise parties conjured up in the Room of Requirement? Once an empty chamber, it transformed into a wonderland of excitement, filled with dancing, spellbinding performances, and an endless array of delectable treats.

## Conclusion

As we conclude this chapter, we bid farewell to the extraordinary world of the Marauders, whose parties and celebrations left an indelible mark on the tapestry of Hogwarts history. In the next chapter, we shall embark on a thrilling adventure with the Marauders, exploring their ingenious map and its many secrets!

## The Party-Planning Code: Explained

The Marauders, being skilled wizards and devotees of mischief alike, developed a party-planning code to keep their festive secrets well-guarded. As we explore this code, we unveil the magic behind their covert communication.

```python
def plan_party(theme, location, date):
    code_name = encrypt(theme)
    encrypt_location = encrypt(location)
    encrypt_date = encrypt(date)
    
    return "We shall gather together for a grand celebration of {} on {} at {}.".format(code_name, encrypt_location, encrypt_date)

def encrypt(message):
    encrypted_message = ""
    for letter in message:
        if letter.isalpha():
            if letter.isupper():
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 65 + 3) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                encrypted_message += chr((ord(letter) - 97 + 3) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            encrypted_message += letter

    return encrypted_message
```

In the `plan_party` function, the Marauders pass three essential parameters: the party's theme, the location of the gathering, and the specified date. These elements are crucial for orchestrating a successful celebration.

### Encryption Magic: Protecting Party Secrets

To safeguard their plans, the Marauders invoked the power of encryption - a fundamental technique used to transform readable text into a secret code. In their custom `encrypt` function, the Marauders utilized a simple substitution cipher to encrypt each letter of the message.

The encryption process involved shifting each letter of the alphabet by three positions. Upper and lowercase letters were handled separately to maintain their respective cases. For example, the letter 'A' would become 'D' after encryption, while 't' would become 'w'. Non-alphabetic characters remained intact during the encryption process.

### Example Usage: Party Planning in Code

Let's explore an example to understand how the Marauders' code would be utilized within a party planning scenario:

```python
theme = "Yule Ball"
location = "Room of Requirement"
date = "December 24th"
party_plan = plan_party(theme, location, date)
print(party_plan)
```

**Output**
```
We shall gather together for a grand celebration of Ahoh Eduho on Urree si Vuuyuhqwbrxu at Ghsduh 27vk.
```

In this example, the Marauders planned a party with the theme "Yule Ball," to be held at the "Room of Requirement" on "December 24th." By applying their encryption function to each element of the party plan, they transformed the details into a mysterious code. When printed, the encrypted party plan reveals only hints of what the celebration truly entails, leaving curious minds eager to decipher its meaning.

Thus, the Marauders' clever party-planning code allowed them to communicate their festive plans discreetly. It added an extra layer of enchantment to their mischievous endeavors and left their fellow Hogwarts students wondering about the secret behind each coded message.

Feel free to explore the Marauders' code further, adapt it for your own magical parties, and let your imagination run wild with the possibilities!
