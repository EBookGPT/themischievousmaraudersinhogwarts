At the forefront of the castle's defenses is the mighty **Magic Shield**. This magical barrier is woven into the very fabric of Hogwarts, shielding it from dark forces and ensuring that only those with pure intentions may pass. The Marauders had to find a way to overcome this formidable protection if they were to continue their mischievous adventures.

## The Riddle of the Sphinx

As the old legends tell, hidden within the depths of Hogwarts lies a *hidden room* guarded by a riddle-wielding Sphinx. Courageous students who dared to approach the room were met with a mystical creature adorned with the head of a human and the body of a lioness.

To gain access to the concealed room, one must solve the Sphinx's riddle flawlessly. It is said that the answer to the riddle changes with each passing year, ensuring the continuity of the castle's security. The Marauders, being clever Gryffindors, couldn't resist the challenge. They labored over the riddle, reading countless books from the library, poring through historical accounts, and consulting ancient texts to find the elusive solution.

```python
def solve_sphinx_riddle(riddle):
    answer = input("What is your answer to the Sphinx's riddle? ")
    if answer.lower() == riddle.lower():
        print("Congratulations, you have solved the riddle!")
        return True
    else:
        print("The Sphinx's riddle remains unsolved. Try again!")
        return False
```

## Protective Portraits and Password Charms

Within the enchanted hallways of Hogwarts, the Marauders faced an additional layer of security in the form of *protective portraits*. These enchanted paintings adorned the castle walls, housing the spirits of past wizards and witches who watch over the students, ready to sound the alarm if any unauthorized individuals pass by.

In order to bypass these vigilant guardians, the Marauders realized they needed to utilize the various *password charms* placed on the portraits. These unique incantations allowed access to hidden passages and secret rooms throughout the castle. Carefully studying the ins and outs of the castle, the Marauders managed to map out the locations of these hidden doors and gather the passwords to unlock them.

```python
passwords = {
    "Fat Lady": "Flibbertigibbet",
    "Sir Cadogan": "Pig snout",
    "The Grey Lady": "Helena Ravenclaw",
    "The Fat Friar": "Yellow",
    "Fruit Bowl Portrait": "Pears",
}

def unlock_door(portrait_name):
    password = input("Enter the password: ")
    if password.lower() == passwords[portrait_name].lower():
        print("Door unlocked! Proceed, mischievous Marauder!")
    else:
        print("That's the wrong password! No passage for you!")
```

## In Conclusion

As our daring Marauders discovered, exploring the mysteries of Hogwarts Castle means overcoming a web of enchantments and security measures. The Magic Shield, Sphinx's riddles, protective portraits, and password charms all came together to guard the castle's secrets from the prying eyes of miscreants.

So, dear readers, brace yourselves for the next chapter, where our mischievous Marauders put their newfound knowledge to good use and embark on a thrilling adventure fueled by secret passageways, hidden rooms, and spellbinding challenges. Until then, remember to honor the castle's security measures and tread carefully through the magical realm of Hogwarts.

## Code Explanation: The Riddle of the Sphinx

Within our unfolding tale of Hogwarts Security Measures lies a pivotal challenge faced by our daring Marauders—the enigmatic riddle of the Sphinx. To bring this segment to life, let us explore the code that allows our readers to emulate the Marauders' quest to solve the Sphinx's riddle.

```python
def solve_sphinx_riddle(riddle):
    answer = input("Pray, what be thy answer to the Sphinx's riddle? ")
    if answer.lower() == riddle.lower():
        print("Huzzah! Thou hast unraveled the riddle!")
        return True
    else:
        print("Alas! The Sphinx's riddle remains unsolved. Try again!")
        return False
```

### Function Explanation

The `solve_sphinx_riddle()` function accepts a single parameter, `riddle`, which represents the enigmatic question posed by the Sphinx.

1. Upon calling the function, the code prompts the reader with a question, "Pray, what be thy answer to the Sphinx's riddle?" The reader is then expected to provide their response.

2. The answer provided by the reader is stored in the `answer` variable.

3. The code then performs a comparison operation, using the `lower()` function to convert both the reader's answer and the Sphinx's riddle to lowercase. This ensures case insensitivity during the evaluation.

4. If the reader's answer matches the Sphinx's riddle, the code prints the triumphant message, "Huzzah! Thou hast unraveled the riddle!" and returns `True` to signify success.

5. If the reader's answer does not match the Sphinx's riddle, the code displays the despondent message, "Alas! The Sphinx's riddle remains unsolved. Try again!" and returns `False` to indicate failure.

By employing this code, our readers can step into the shoes of our Marauders and test their mettle against the Sphinx's cunning riddle. Only through knowledge, wit, and perseverance will they succeed, unlocking the secrets of the hidden chamber and venturing further into the enchanting world of Hogwarts.

> *Joke: Why did the Sphinx go to Hogwarts? Because it wanted to riddle its way to the top of the class!*

Stay enchanted as we proceed, noble readers, for the realm of Hogwarts continues to unfold its mysteries in the coming chapters of the Mischievous Marauders in Hogwarts saga!
