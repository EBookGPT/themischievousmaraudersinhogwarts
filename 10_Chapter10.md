*_"Troublesome times call for troublesome pranks."_*

Welcome, dear reader, to the tenth chapter of our thrilling misadventures with the mischievous marauders of Hogwarts. In this chapter, we unveil the tale of a legendary prank — one that shook the very foundations of Hogwarts and left the notorious Dolores Umbridge red-faced and humiliated.

## Background: The Reign of Umbridge

Before we delve into the epic prank, it is important to understand the context. After the departure of Albus Dumbledore, Dolores Umbridge, a stern witch with questionable methods, was appointed as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. Under her tyrannical regime, Hogwarts became a place filled with oppressive rules, restrictions, and unforgiving punishments.

## The Marauders' Call to Action

The mischievous marauders could not bear to witness their beloved school being suffocated under Umbridge's rule. Armed with their ingenuity, magical prowess, and a touch of audacity, they decided it was time to take matters into their own hands. 

## The Birth of the Legendary Prank

Inspired by tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the marauders crafted a plan reminiscent of the legendary sword in the stone. They knew that Umbridge had an insatiable appetite for authority, so they decided to create an enchanted decree that would lure her into a trap of her own making.

## The Prank Unfolds

With the assistance of their Marauder's Map, the mischievous quartet obtained a fragment of Umbridge's handwriting. Utilizing their skills in enchanting, they designed a parchment that would respond to the touch of anyone who bore a resemblance to Dolores Umbridge. Their magical creation would temporarily alter her appearance, replacing her long, curly hair with a vibrant shade of bright pink.

## The Grand Reveal

Under the guise of a secret meeting, the marauders placed the enchanted parchment within a stack of regular decrees awaiting Umbridge's approval. It didn't take long for the trap to spring into motion. As she arrogantly seized the parchment, the magical transformation unfolded before her shocked eyes, leaving her hair a brilliant shade of pink for all to see.

## The Nocturnal Escape and the Marauders' Legacy

As anticipated, Umbridge's embarrassment was so severe that she abruptly ended the meeting, allowing the marauders to slip away unnoticed into the night. The Legendary Prank became the talk of Hogwarts, spreading through the school like a wildfire. The marauders cemented their place in Hogwarts history, leaving behind an enduring legacy for future mischief-makers to admire and aspire to.

## A Lesson in Wit and Courage

In this chapter, we witness the triumph of creativity, wit, and camaraderie against an oppressive regime. The marauders taught us that sometimes, in the darkest of times, levity and laughter can be potent weapons against tyranny. Through their prank, they reminded us that unity, loyalty, and the pursuit of a just cause can indeed bring hope and joy to even the most challenging of situations.

So let us venture forth and relive the legendary prank that brought Dolores Umbridge to her knees, as it is a testament to the indomitable spirit of Hogwarts and the power of mischievous ingenuity!

*_"Troublesome times call for troublesome pranks."_*

Welcome, dear reader, to the tenth chapter of our enthralling tale, where the mischievous marauders of Hogwarts find themselves entwined in a whimsical story inspired by the legendary tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Prepare yourself as we journey through the corridors of Hogwarts, where bravery, camaraderie, and a touch of wizarding magic intertwine to orchestrate the most legendary prank ever witnessed.

## The Reign of Umbridge: A Dark Era

In the realm of Hogwarts, a time of darkness befell the castle, with the arrival of Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor. She ruled over the students and teachers with an iron fist, imposing oppressive rules and punishments that cast a shadow over the school. But where there is darkness, there is a spark of mischief waiting to ignite.

## The Marauders' Quest: Defenders of Hogwarts

Amidst the turmoil, four mischievous marauders emerged, bearing the names of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. United by their unwavering bond, they pledged to bring laughter and light back to their beloved school. Like the knights of the legendary Round Table, they were bound by honor, loyalty, and a deep love for mischief.

## The Legendary Prank Takes Form

Inspired by tales of King Arthur's wisdom and valor, the marauders devised a plan that would thrust Dolores Umbridge into a whirlwind of embarrassment and expose her true colors for all to see. Like skilled enchanters, they created a magical decree, concealed within a parchment that would magically react when touched by the very hand of Umbridge herself.

## The Transforming Enchantment: A Prank Unleashed

With cunning and precision, the marauders crafted a spell that would transform Umbridge's appearance, revealing the truth hidden beneath her façade. The enchanted parchment bore a charm that would convert her luscious locks of hair into a vibrant pink hue, a vivid symbol of her own vanity and misguided authority.

## The Trap is Set: The Grand Reveal

Under the cover of night, the marauders carefully placed the enchanted parchment amidst a stack of official decrees, ensuring it would find its way into Umbridge's hands. And so it came to pass that during a critical meeting, as Umbridge's hand closed around the fateful parchment, a magical spectacle unfolded before the astonished onlookers. Her delicate curls transformed into a shade of outrageous pink, leaving her momentarily dumbfounded and utterly humiliated.

## Triumph Against Tyranny: The Nocturnal Escape

In the aftermath of their audacious prank, the marauders made their swift escape, slipping away into the night like shadows. The news of Umbridge's undoing spread through Hogwarts like wildfire, bringing an air of jubilation to its halls. The marauders had struck a blow against the oppressive regime, giving hope to the students and teachers alike, even if only for a fleeting moment.

## A Legacy Remembered

The legend of the marauders' pranks echoed through the corridors of Hogwarts for generations to come. Their actions serve as a reminder to all mischievous souls that in the face of adversity, a well-timed prank can be a powerful tool to disrupt, expose, and rally others to the cause of justice. The marauders left an indelible mark on the history of Hogwarts, reminding us that unity, loyalty, and a touch of wizarding ingenuity can shape the course of even the darkest times.

## The Code Behind "The Legendary Prank: Umbridge's Undoing"

```python
def enchant_parchment(parchment):
    """

    Transforms her hair into a vibrant shade of pink.
    """
    magic_spell = enchantment_factory.create_spell("hair_transformation")
    parchment.enchant(magic_spell)

def prank_umbridge(marauders, umbridge):
    """

    Sets up the enchanted parchment and triggers the transformation.
    """
    parchment = MaraudersMap.find_parchment()

    umbridge.touch_parchment(parchment)

def resolve_legendary_prank():
    """

```

In our grand tale of "The Legendary Prank: Umbridge's Undoing," the mischievous marauders utilize their craftiness and magical skills to orchestrate a masterful prank against Dolores Umbridge. This prank involves enchanting a parchment and triggering a magical transformation upon her touch.

To bring this prank to life, we employ the following code:

- The `enchant_parchment` function is responsible for enchanting the parchment with a magical spell. In this case, the spell chosen is "hair_transformation," which will convert Umbridge's hair into a vibrant shade of pink.
- The `prank_umbridge` function brings together the marauders and Umbridge as the key players in the prank. It locates a parchment using the MaraudersMap, enchants it, and then triggers Umbridge to touch the parchment, initiating the spell.
- Finally, the `resolve_legendary_prank` function is the culmination of the prank. It gathers the marauders, retrieves Umbridge's information from Hogwarts, and calls on `prank_umbridge` to execute the prank. The function then prints the outcome, unveiling Umbridge's magically transformed pink hair and the ensuing laughter and amusement that engulfs the halls of Hogwarts.

With the mischievous marauders and their magical code, the legendary prank against Dolores Umbridge is brought to life, leaving a lasting mark on the history of Hogwarts and a reminder of the power of wit and creativity in the face of adversity.

> "*It is through their cunning and enchantments that the marauders turn a prank into a legend.*"
