## The Legend of the Howler

Long ago, in the magical realm of Hogwarts, there was a legend whispered among the halls of the castle. It was said that King Arthur and his loyal Knights of the Round Table faced a peculiar challenge—The Mystery of the Howler. According to the ancient tale, a mighty Howler appeared before them, carrying a message that held the key to a secret yet unknown. But it was only through the genius of Fred and George Weasley, with the assistance of their special guest Lee Jordan, that the mystery was solved.

## The Arrival of Lee Jordan

The knights' journey towards unraveling the enigma of the Howler took an unexpected turn when a familiar face emerged from the shadows—the witty and mischievous Lee Jordan. Just like Merlin, the great sorcerer of old, Lee had a gift for storytelling and a passion for mischief. As he joined forces with Fred and George, the trio knew that they possessed the necessary brilliance to face this challenge head-on.

## A Mysterious Invitation

One sunny morning, as the knights gathered in the Great Hall, an enchanted horn echoed through the castle, drawing their attention. Slowly, a brilliant red envelope appeared, emitting an eerie hum that signaled the arrival of the unrevealed message within. All eyes turned to King Arthur, who, with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension, gingerly opened the envelope to reveal the cryptic contents.

## The Howler's Riddle

Within the velvet folds of the envelope, a parchment unfolded, displaying a riddle that seemed to taunt the knights with its complexity:

```
I travel through air,
With words, I declare,
Mysterious yet clear,
Sound echoes in fear.
Unravel my code,
With cunning bestowed,
From the shadows it flees,
Reveal what you seize.
```

The knights exchanged intrigued glances, for they knew this riddle concealed a secret that could change the course of their quest forever.

## The Brilliance of Fred and George

Fred and George, ever the embodiment of the knights' spirit, immediately recognized this riddle as a challenge awaiting their unrivaled intelligence. Like Arthur's trusty sword, Excalibur, their minds were finely honed for solving such mysterious conundrums. With Lee Jordan at their side, the trio embarked on a journey of code-cracking ingenuity.

## A Tale of Decryption

The knights meticulously examined the riddle, searching for patterns hidden within its intricate web of words. It was said that in their quest for knowledge, the knights frequently turned to the writings of the great wizard Albus Dumbledore. In one of his published journals, they discovered a technique known as the "Caesar Cipher," which could provide insights into the decryption of the Howler's mysterious code.

Following the guidance found within Dumbledore's words, Fred and George crafted their very own algorithm to decrypt the hidden message. With each shift of a letter, a whole new world of possibilities opened before their eyes.

```python
# Decrypting the Howler's message
def decrypt_howler(howler_text):
    decrypted_msg = ""

    for char in howler_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + 13) % 26 + ord('A'))
            decrypted_msg += decrypted_char
        else:
            decrypted_msg += char

    return decrypted_msg

howler_text = "URYYB JBEYQ!"
decrypted_message = decrypt_howler(howler_text)

print(decrypted_message)  # "HELLO WORLD!"
```

## Triumph and Revelations

With their code-cracking expertise, Fred, George, and Lee unveiled the true meaning behind the Howler's riddle. It contained a message, "HELLO WORLD!"—a greeting from an unknown sender, beckoning the knights deeper into the realm of mystery.

Much like Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the Marauders' mischievous journey had only just begun. The Howler's revelation unleashed a series of adventures, camaraderie, and pranks that would forever be cherished in the annals of Hogwarts history.

## Conclusion

Oh, dear reader, as you turn the pages of this chapter, you shall gaze upon the extraordinary minds of Fred and George Weasley, joined by the raucous laughter and wit of Lee Jordan. Together, they proved that even the most formidable challenges could be overcome with determination, intellect, and a pinch of mischief. Brace yourself for the unraveling of the Mystery of the Howler—a tale of enchantment, lessons in code, and the bonds forged amidst mischievous endeavors. Let the adventure commence!
## Code Explanation: Decrypting the Howler's Message

The code used by Fred and George to decrypt the message hidden within the Howler's riddle is an example of a simple encryption technique called the "Caesar Cipher." This cipher involves shifting each letter in the message a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

```python
# Decrypting the Howler's message
def decrypt_howler(howler_text):
    decrypted_msg = ""

    for char in howler_text:
        if char.isalpha():
            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + 13) % 26 + ord('A'))
            decrypted_msg += decrypted_char
        else:
            decrypted_msg += char

    return decrypted_msg

howler_text = "URYYB JBEYQ!"
decrypted_message = decrypt_howler(howler_text)

print(decrypted_message)  # "HELLO WORLD!"
```

Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. We define a function called `decrypt_howler` that takes a string `howler_text` as input and returns the decrypted message.

2. Within the function, we create an empty string `decrypted_msg` to store the decrypted characters of the message.

3. We iterate over each character `char` in the `howler_text` string.

4. To ensure that only alphabetic characters are encrypted, we use the `isalpha()` method to check if the current character is a letter.

5. If the character is a letter, we perform the decryption operation. The expression `(ord(char) - ord('A') + 13) % 26 + ord('A')` shifts the character 13 positions down the alphabet.

6. We convert the shifted character back to its corresponding ASCII value using the `chr()` method and assign it to `decrypted_char`.

7. The decrypted character is then appended to the `decrypted_msg` string.

8. If the character is not a letter (e.g., punctuation or space), we simply add it to the `decrypted_msg` string without any encryption.

9. After iterating through all the characters in the `howler_text` string, we return the fully decrypted message stored in `decrypted_msg`.

10. Finally, we provide an example `howler_text` and call the `decrypt_howler` function to decrypt it. The resulting decrypted message is then printed: "HELLO WORLD!"

By using the Caesar Cipher technique, Fred and George were able to decipher the hidden message within the Howler's riddle and unlock the next chapter of their mischievous adventure at Hogwarts.
